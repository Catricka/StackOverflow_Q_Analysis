title = Processing inside method vs retrieving
body =I would like to know your opinion on this problem:

We have races (represented by the class Race), races have different types of runners (represented by superclass Runner) and every runner belongs to a team.

The race is won by the team which has the highest score (score is calculated as the sum of the scores of the team's players).

class Race{
   private List&lt;Runner&gt; runner;
}

class abstract Runner{
   private String name;
   private String team;

   protected abstract Integer getPoints();
}

class RunnerType1 extends Runner{
   // ...

   protected Integer getPoints() {
     // ...
   }
}

class RunnerType2 extends Runner{
   // ...

   protected Integer getPoints() {
     // ...
   }
}

public class Stats{
   private List&lt;Races&gt; races;


}


We want to 


Get the winning team for every race.

Would you store the winning team in a new property "String winner" or would you iterate over runners every time the method getWinner() is called?
Get the runner with the highest score in the entire set of races.

You would have to iterate over the races list but: would you create a method getPlayersStats() returning a Map (player name -> points) or would you get the players array of the race and do all the business logic outside of the Race class?


Thanks in advance.

title = &quot;The type must implement the inherited abstract method Application.start(Stage)&quot; while method is both included and overridden
body =Java FX noob, but I've tried all I know and can find from others on the web. I've verified the JVM to be at version 1.8 and cleaned/rebuilt the entire package.

Trying to make a program that displays 3 objects one after the other, forever on an empty background, until program crash/close, within a class called Painter. 
It is called/driven by a Controller class within the same package.

The methods in Painter are start(), run() and main(), the first two have errors as well as the class declaration itself. 

The class declaration has the titular error.
run() is overridden but still has the complaint "must override or inherit a supertype method". 
start() has a few errors. I attempted to make it implement Application directly but it still complains about it.

title = Algorithm to count free blocks until there is a used block
body =It exists a 2 Dimensional Array for a field of (x,y) length, here for instance 9x6. What I need to do here is to check how many free fields are around the Orange and Red Star. The black (filled) fields represent the occupied fields. In this example for instance I have 7 free fields for Orange, 1 for Red. I know that I can loop through each field and see whether one field is occupied or not, but how could I loop through so that I know that these non-occupied fields are next to the Star or in the Radius of the Star of non-occupied fields? I hope I could elaborate my question well.



Field[][] fields = new Field[9][6];

private void checkEmptyFields(Star star) {
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 9; i++){ // Hardcoded size as an example
 for (int j = 0; i &lt; 6; i++) {
   if(fields[i][j].isOccupied())
    { 
     //It is occupied, but what now?
    }
  }
 }
}


isOccupied Function:

public boolean isOccupied(){
return occupied;
}


I expect the output to be in this example Orange: 7, Red: 1 (because Red is blocked by the Orange Star and the occupied boxes)

title = Solving osgi classloading issues with jax-rs clients
body =Imagine you have a module A which provides a static method that is used by module B. This method uses a jax-rs client to retrieve information from a webservice. The information is returned as a string. Module B is already a osgi bundle. Now module A also needs to be transformed to an osgi bundle but it is not allowed to change any code of it. So you can only add the required metadata to the manifest file. I did that and embedded all dependencies (including a jax-rs client) into a single jar file. Now, if module B calls the static method of module A I get a ClassNotFoundException since the classloader of module B is used to find the jax-rs client. I did some debugging and if I execute the line Thread.currentThread().setContextClassLoader(this.getClass().getClassLoader()) in module A everything works, because now the classloader of module A is used and the client is found on the classpath of that module. Since I cannot change any code of module A this solution does not work for me. Does anyone has another hint for me how I can deal with these classloading issues?

title = In JNI function when I change an Array in-place that was passed from Java code the Array doesn&#39;t modify
body =I'm passing an int array from Java to native method. 
Then within JNI function I created a pointer to int array with GetIntArrayElements() and pass as *isCopy argument JNI_FALSE. I supposed that this will not create a copy of the original array and I could modify array in place. Then I use ReleaseIntArrayElements() and pass as mode argument JNI_ABORT to just relese buffer. But that didn't work.

From JNI documentation:


mode 0: copy back the content and free the elems buffer
mode JNI_COMMIT: copy back the content but do not free the elems buffer
mode JNI_ABORT: free the buffer without copying back the possible changes


That when I tried to use mode "0" in ReleaseIntArrayElements() that worked perfectly. But I don't understand why cause I didn't create a copy of the original array and mode "0" is copying back the content.

I suppose that JNI always create a copy of the original array. But then *isCopy argument in GetIntArrayElements() lose its sense. So what really happening with this?

THIS IS MY JNI FUCNTION

extern "C" JNIEXPORT jdouble JNICALL
Java_my_own_package_MainActivity_myFunction(
    JNIEnv *env,
    jobject /* this */, jintArray tbl) {

    tblptr[0] = 0; //in-place change
    env-&gt;ReleaseDoubleArrayElements(tb1, tblptr, JNI_ABORT);
    return 0;
